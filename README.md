# Middleman Meets Susy - DEMO

For Tokyo Middleman Meetup #1.
This project uses Middleman & Susy grid system.

https://speakerdeck.com/kumanoayumi/middleman-meets-susy

## How do I use it?

Start by installing [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/), if you don't already have it:

```
gem install bundler
```

Then just download the [latest source](https://github.com/kumanoayumi/mms) or if you prefer, clone the repository down to your local machine:

```
git clone http://github.com/nathos/amicus.git my_new_project
```

Finally, do a ```bundle install``` to install the required gems -- even Middleman itself!

Use ```middleman``` to do your live development and ```middleman build``` to render your static file output to the ```/build/``` directory.

For full Middleman documentation, visit the [Middleman website](http://middlemanapp.com/).
